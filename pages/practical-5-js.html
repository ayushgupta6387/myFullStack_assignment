        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting
        language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many
        non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for
        Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript
        contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and
        a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and
        statements.
